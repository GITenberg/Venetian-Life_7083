description: At the outbreak of the Civil War, Howells was appointed United States
  consul in Venice, Italy. In Venetian Life , an utterly engaging travelogue, Howells
  revises a series of travel letters he had written about his experiences in Venice
  for the Boston Advertiser . Honest in its love for (yet discomfort in) Venice, it
  would be followed by Italian Journeys .
